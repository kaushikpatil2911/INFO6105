# Data Science Engineering and Tools

●	Analyzed and performed feature engineering on Amazon Product Reviews of Fashion, Appliances and Prime Pantry

●	Explored and classified customer sentiments into positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

●	Mapped flow of code from importing data followed by data preprocessing, training and validation set, model training, predictions and accuracies of different algorithms and finally sentiment analysis of Amazon Reviews

●	Balanced 80% Positive 20% negative data and used TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction which will tokenize documents, learn and inverse document weightings to further encode new documents

●	Quantified different accuracies of machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression 72%, K-NN 62%, Naive Bayes 87%, Random Forest 76%, Decision Tree 62% and SVM 80% and found Naïve Bayes most optimal algorithm method
